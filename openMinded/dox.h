 * OPENMINDED is the name of a security add-on for the PARROT’s AR Drone 2.0. It is was created by a team 
 * of software engineers in the department of electronics and informatics at the INSA Toulouse. It integrates a real time detection 
 * service, machine learning algorithms and statistical classification, all implemented in order to get a much 
 * secure drone. 
 * 
 * Our product integrates three different classification algorithms: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support 
 * Vector Machine) and NBC (Naïve Bayes Classifier). We provided an easy to use graphical interface. The 
 * user may view the current situation of the drone, therefore knowing any obstacle the drone may 
 * encounter. In case of an accident, an integrated reaction module will perform the required procedure in 
 * order to avoid the obstacle ergo preventing any danger. 
 * 
 * For the experienced users, our product can be modified in order to add more classified situations for a 
 * very secure drone. 
 * 
 * Our project offers an application for both the casual user and the experienced programmer in order to 
 * avoid any dangerous situation that the drone may encounter during the flight mode.
