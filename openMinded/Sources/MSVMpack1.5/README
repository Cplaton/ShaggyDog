This is MSVMpack: a Multi-class Support Vector Machine package

To build the library and command-line tools, run:

	make

For a system-wide install of the tools, run (with root privileges):

	make install
	
On Windows, you should instead run 

	Windows\setPath.bat
	
then exit the MS-DOS window and open a new one
for the setting to take effect.
	
	
To train an M-SVM, use:
	
	trainmsvm mydata myMSVM.model
	
To classify data, use:

	predmsvm mydata myMSVM.model
	
To start the web server, use:

	msvmserver start
	
See the documentation in doc/ for further options or just run 

	trainmsvm
